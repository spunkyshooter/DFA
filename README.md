# DFA
C++ programs for some deterministic finite automata.
It shows the transitions of the states and the result whether it is accepted or not.

Questions:
1.  Design a DFA to accept all the strings over alphabet {0,1}
    which are divisible by 3 
2.  Design a DFA to accept all the strings over alphabet {a,b} 
    , having "b" at the starting and "aba" at the end
3.  Design a DFA to accept all the strings over alphabet {a,b} 
    ,having "abba" at the end
4.  Design a DFA to accept all the strings over alphabet {a,b} 
    ,having even numner of a and odd number of b
5.  Design a DFA for accepting L = { w : Na(w) mod 3 > Nb(w) mod 3}
6.  Design a DFA for accepting L = { w : (Na(w) - Nb(w) )mod 3 > 0 }
7.  Design a DFA for accepting L = {ab^(n)a^(m) : n >= 2 , m >= 3}
8.  Design a DFA for accepting L = {ab^(5)a^(2) : w belongs to {a,b}^*}
9.  Design a DFA for accepting L = {w1abw2 : w1 belongs to {a,b}^* , w2 belongs to {a,b}^*}
10.  Design a DFA for accepting L = { w : (Na(w) + 2*Nb(w) )mod 3 < 0 }
